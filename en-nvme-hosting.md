View NVMe Hosting plans  Learn about NVMe

## What is NVMe? Why is NVMe faster than SSD?
NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) is a next-generation storage protocol designed specifically for flash drives.

### 10x higher IOPS
NVMe can handle 1 million IOPS, while SATA SSD only reaches 100,000 IOPS. Websites and databases respond significantly faster.

### Ultra-low latency < 0.1ms
NVMe communicates directly via PCIe with latency of only 0.02-0.1ms, compared to 0.5-1ms of traditional SATA SSD.

### 3,500 MB/s Throughput
Read/write speed up to 3,500 MB/s, 7x faster than SATA SSD (500 MB/s). Ideal for high-traffic websites.

### RAID-10 data safety
Combining NVMe with RAID-10 ensures both speed and data safety. No data loss when drive encounters issues.
