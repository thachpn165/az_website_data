Criteria  |  DirectAdmin Reseller  |  cPanel Reseller
---|---|---
Plans  |  6 plans (Reseller 1-6)  |  __6 plans (Starter, 1-5)
Storage  |  20GB - 200GB SSD  |  __10GB - 200GB SSD
Client Accounts  |  Unlimited (all plans)  |  __10 - 300 accounts
Starting Price  |  269,000đ/month  |  __269,000đ/month
Management Interface  |  DirectAdmin + Evolution Skin  |  __cPanel + WHM (more popular)
Resources/account  |  Self-allocate unlimited  |  __Limited by account count
Popularity  |  Growing rapidly  |  __Most popular worldwide
License Cost  |  Lower  |  __Higher
WHM Access  |  Full  |  __Full
White-label  |  Yes  |  __Yes
Private Nameserver  |  Yes  |  __Yes

DirectAdmin is ideal if you need unlimited accounts at lower cost. cPanel is ideal if your clients prefer cPanel or need the most popular interface.

## Frequently Asked Questions
Can I choose between cPanel or DirectAdmin? __

**Yes**. When ordering Reseller Hosting, you can choose cPanel or DirectAdmin based on your preference and business needs. cPanel is popular with user-friendly interface, DirectAdmin is lighter and more license cost-effective. You can also request to switch later if needed.

How is reseller hosting different from shared hosting? __

Reseller hosting lets you create multiple cPanel/DirectAdmin accounts for clients, has WHM access, and is fully white-labeled. Shared hosting only gives you 1 account for personal use and cannot be resold.

Do I need technical knowledge? __

Basic hosting and WHM knowledge is sufficient. AZDIGI provides detailed guides and dedicated reseller support team to assist you when needed.

Will my clients know about AZDIGI? __

No. With complete white-labeling and private nameserver (ns1.yourdomain.com), clients only see your brand. AZDIGI commits not to contact reseller's clients directly.

Can I integrate billing? __

Yes. You can integrate with billing systems like WHMCS, Blesta, or manage payments yourself in your own way.

Is there a client limit? __

Account limits depend on plan (20/50/Unlimited). You manage within your package's resources (disk, bandwidth). You can upgrade anytime when you need more.

What does AZDIGI support for resellers? __

AZDIGI supports infrastructure, server, security and complex technical issues. You're responsible for directly supporting your clients. Resellers have priority support channel.

Can I upgrade to a larger package? __

Yes. You can upgrade your reseller package anytime when you need more resources. The system automatically calculates the price difference based on remaining days.
