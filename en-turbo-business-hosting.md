## How is Turbo Business different from Premium Business?
Both are premium hosting, but Turbo Business delivers the ultimate experience with dedicated IP and isolated resources.

Criteria  |  Premium Business  |  Turbo Business
---|---|---
Positioning  |  Premium business hosting  |  __AZDIGI's most premium hosting
Dedicated IP  |  No  |  __Yes (from plan 3+)
Resources  |  Dedicated but shared server  |  __Isolated, not affected by other users
CPU  |  Intel Platinum / AMD EPYC  |  __Intel Xeon Platinum 3.8GHz+
Disk I/O  |  200MB/s  |  __300MB/s (50% higher)
Technical support  |  Priority 24/7  |  __VIP Priority 24/7
Cache  |  Redis + LSCache  |  __Redis + LSCache

Turbo Business is the optimal choice when you need dedicated IP, isolated resources or the highest performance possible on shared hosting platform.

## Turbo Business Hosting FAQ
How is Turbo Business different from Premium Business? __

Turbo Business is AZDIGI's most premium package with dedicated IP from plan 3+, isolated resources, higher Disk I/O (300MB/s vs 200MB/s) and VIP priority support. Suitable for businesses needing good email reputation or maximum performance.

What are the benefits of Dedicated IP? __

Dedicated IP helps: (1) Better email deliverability - not affected if IP is blacklisted by other users, (2) Better SEO - some studies show dedicated IP benefits SEO, (3) Higher security - not sharing IP with other websites, (4) Easier SSL certificate installation with some premium cert types.

Which plans include Dedicated IP? __

Dedicated IP is provided free from Turbo Intel 3 plan onwards. Turbo Intel 1 and 2 use shared IP like regular hosting packages.

What does isolated resources mean? __

Isolated resources means your CPU and RAM are allocated separately, not affected by other websites on same server. This ensures stable performance even when server is under high load.

Is Turbo Business suitable for e-commerce? __

Very suitable! Turbo Business is designed for large e-commerce websites with: powerful resources (up to 12 vCPU, 24GB RAM), dedicated IP helps order emails not go to spam, high Disk I/O for fast database queries, and VIP support when urgent issues arise.

Can I upgrade from Premium Business to Turbo? __

Yes, you can upgrade anytime. We support free data migration and charge the difference based on remaining time. Upgrade process causes no downtime for your website.

When should I choose Turbo instead of VPS? __

Choose Turbo when: you don't want to manage server, need managed environment with 24/7 support, your website fits shared hosting but needs dedicated IP and high performance. Choose VPS when: need full root access, run special software, or need resources beyond Turbo limits.

What is the refund policy? __

We provide 100% refund policy within the first 30 days if you're not satisfied, no reason needed.
