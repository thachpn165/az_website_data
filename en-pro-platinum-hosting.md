## Frequently Asked Questions
Is Pro Platinum suitable for WordPress? __

**Yes**. Pro Platinum is specially optimized for WordPress with LiteSpeed Cache, Redis, and optimal PHP configuration. Suitable for medium to large WordPress websites.

Does Pro Platinum Hosting support vibe-coding websites? __

It depends on what tech-stack your AI-built website uses. AZDIGI hosting supports static sites, PHP/MySQL dynamic sites, and JavaScript frameworks like Node.js, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Astro, etc.

AZDIGI hosting has built-in Web Terminal or SSH Access so you can use `npm` commands to build your app, fully compatible with most popular tech stacks for vibe-coding today.

Are there any limits on free migration? __

AZDIGI provides completely free migration from other hosting providers to AZDIGI servers. The migration schedule will be communicated by our technical team after assessing the workload.

However, AZDIGI may decline migration for highly complex websites or sites with pre-existing errors. AZDIGI does not support fixing existing website bugs before or code-related issues after migration.

AZDIGI also does not support data transfer between AZDIGI services or website cloning/copying.

I'm using Pro Platinum 1, can I upgrade to Pro Platinum 3 later? __

Yes. You can flexibly upgrade to a higher plan within the same service at any time without needing to reconfigure or migrate data.

When upgrading, use the Service Upgrade feature in the management portal. The system will calculate the price difference between plans multiplied by remaining days. After payment, the system automatically upgrades without interruption.

Can I get support when upgrading from Hosting to VPS? __

Yes, AZDIGI provides free migration and configuration when you upgrade from Hosting to VPS or Cloud Server.

However, if your hosting has many websites, the technical team will need more time to migrate and will discuss the schedule beforehand to ensure no interruption.

How long until service is suspended for late payment? Will data be deleted? __

From the service expiration date (not the renewal invoice date), the service will be suspended after 7 days if not paid. After 30 days from suspension, data will be deleted if still unpaid.

After service deletion, AZDIGI keeps backup copies for another 30 days. Customers needing recovery should contact sales or technical support before making payment.
